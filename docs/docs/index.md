# Introduction

Statical is a high-level stats video framework built on top of [D3.js](https://d3js.org), allowing anyone to make a high-quality stats video while still letting them be unique.

## Why was Statical made?

Because we thought that making high-quality stats videos with D3 was too complicated, involving a lot of code that you have to copy and paste a bunch of times.

With Statical, we put the best practices used by many creators such as [JipStats](https://youtube.com/@JipStats), [GNZGUY](https://youtube.com/@GNZGUY) and [MinMax](https://youtube.com/@MinMaxStats) in a simple and easy-to-use package, whilst still giving you the option to make the video your own.
